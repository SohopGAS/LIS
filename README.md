# Longest Increasing Subsequence
the longest increasing subsequence problem is to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. The longest increasing subsequence problem is solvable in time O(n log n). (by Wikipedia). 

This solution in time O(n^2).

List of versions to LIS:
1. ```int lis_long(int arr[], int n);```: Length, Runtime table, Comments and more.
2. ```int lis_short(int arr[], int n);```: Length, Comments and more.
3. ```int lis_short_no_comments(int arr[], int n);```: Length.

The program is very easy to use.

1. You can change in the main function, the array you want as input.
2. Call to exsist function from the list.
4. Run the application.
3. Get the output for your input (LIS).

Have fun :-)
